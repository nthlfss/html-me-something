                                Cape Coast, Ghana and follows many generations over a 300 year period in both Ghana and America, all
                                packed in to 300 pages. Told as a series of linked short stories, the novel's power seems to intensify

                            experimental and yet totally accessible. Terese uses the truths and facts of her own life to explore
                            bigger themes about what it means to be Native now, what it means to be a Native woman, and what it
                            means to write with stakes and grace. The book has teeth and heart and brain. It is a mythical, lyrical
                            work about motherhood, about pain, loss and love. I was left in awe.

                                    This book broke my heart then cradled it in lullabies. Hunt has a breathtaking way with words and is
                                    something like a modern day Shirley Jackson. Confusing in a good way. Much blurring of life and death,

                                    One of the darkest novels I’ve read in years. This is about as barbarous as fiction gets, but the
                                    violence is not gratuitous. Many of his charactersmanage to maintain unexpected shreds of humanity and
                                    humor despite the murder and lust and hypocrisy they perpetuate. Pollock’s three plots braid
                                    beautifully, and brutally, together until an ending that’s as satisfying as everything that comes before
                                    it.

                                    Delirious and extraordinary, and much unlike anything else I've read this year, perhaps ever before.
                                    Cultish, crazy, clever, calamitous, this story - in the deepness of it's madness - felt absolutely
                                    bottomless. Reading it can be analogized to experiencing the height of a fever, that's how constant and
                                    surreal its plot gushes outward. Humored and fantastical, endlessly creative in its scope, it's an

                                    It still astounds me how a decades old horror story can continue to captivate and terrify a modern-day
                                    audience, more attuned to altogether grislier, bloodier, and gorier tales. Very impressed with the
                                    writing and tone. The story is simple and vague and devolves into insanity, but the unique emphasis on
                                    psychology and subtle social interactions is wonderful.
