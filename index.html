            <h3>Borne</h3>
            <p>I really fell into this book like it was a weird, barren and disturbing hole. I started reading it and then just could not put it down until I was done. Jeff Vandermeer’s imagination is insane. The dystopian world he’s built, and the characters that live in it, are so richly realized and so weird that I stopped reading a few times just to wonder, What kind of brain comes up with this stuff? </p>

            <h3>Homegoing</h3>
            <p>Absolutely stunning. An astonishing scope of history for such a slim novel. This family saga starts in Cape Coast, Ghana and follows many generations over a 300 year period in both Ghana and America, all packed in to 300 pages. Told as a series of linked short stories, the novel's power seems to intensify with each generation.</p>

            <h3>Heart Berries</h3>
            <p>Heart Berries is heartbreaking and breathtaking in its scope, vision, and beauty. It is formally experimental and yet totally accessible.  Terese uses the truths and facts of her own life to explore bigger themes about what it means to be Native now, what it means to be a Native woman, and what it means to write with stakes and grace. The book has teeth and heart and brain. It is a mythical, lyrical work about motherhood, about pain, loss and love. I was left in awe.</p>

            <h3>The Days of Abandonment</h3>
            <p>This was not an easy book to read, or finish. I was disturbed by how much I loathed all the characters, but I couldn't stop reading. Ferrante is a wonderful writer, and even if you find the characters as distasteful as I did her language and writing keep you turning the pages.</p>

            <h3>Mr. Splitfoot</h3>
            <p>This book broke my heart then cradled it in lullabies. Hunt has a breathtaking way with words and is something like a modern day Shirley Jackson. Confusing in a good way. Much blurring of life and death, magic and deception, the imagined and the real.</p>

            <h3>The Devil All the Time</h3>
            <p>One of the darkest novels I’ve read in yearse. This is about as barbarous as fiction gets, but the violence is not gratuitous. Many of his charactersmanage to maintain unexpected shreds of humanity and humor despite the murder and lust and hypocrisy they perpetuate. Pollock’s three plots braid beautifully, and brutally, together until an ending that’s as satisfying as everything that comes before it.</p>

            <img src="images/becoming.jpg" alt="Becoming book cover" width="155" height="235">
            <h3>Becoming</h3>
            <p>An authentic story of the life of an inspiring woman, who has faced challenges and experienced great privilege with humility and gratitude. The Obamas legacy will always be the value they place on hard work, true human connection, and commitment to equity; values which underscore every story in this book. A wonderful read.</p>

                height="235">
            <h3>The Library at Mount Char</h3>
            <p>Delirious and extraordinary, and much unlike anything else I've read this year, perhaps ever before. Cultish, crazy, clever, calamitous, this story - in the deepness of it's madness - felt absolutely bottomless. Reading it can be analogized to experiencing the height of a fever, that's how constant and surreal its plot gushes outward. Humored and fantastical, endlessly creative in its scope, it's an instant, inspired favorite.</p>

            <h3>The Haunting of Hill House</h3>
            <p>It still astounds me how a decades old horror story can continue to captivate and terrify a modern-day audience, more attuned to altogether grislier, bloodier, and gorier tales. Very impressed with the writing and tone. The story is simple and vague and devolves into insanity, but the unique emphasis on psychology and subtle social interactions is wonderful.</p>

            <img src="images/iamlegend.jpg" alt="I Am Legend book cover" width="155" height="235">
            <h3>I Am Legend</h3>
            <p>Equal parts survival story, post-apocalyptic story, zombie invasion story, mystery, recovery story, allegory, and thriller, this was one of those books where you have to pull back every once in a while and marvel at how beautifully this machine runs. Suspenseful, harrowing, terrifying. Excellent. It never missteps.</p>
